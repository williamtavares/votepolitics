Let the internet decide.

Anybody can cast a vote and doesn't require you to register.

The 2016 Presidential Campaign has had many candidates but it is up to the voter to decide who the next president will be.

VotePolitics is a polling website made to let anyone cast a vote as well as keeping tracking of any candidate via Google News and their Twitter feed.
